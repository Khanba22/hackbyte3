// Steps

// 1. Fetch the user's query and location (latitude and longitude).
// 2. Retrieve the list of hospitals and their details, including their latitude, longitude, and severity levels.
// 3. Prune the list of hospitals based on the following distance criteria:
//    - For high severity cases (severity >= 8), exclude hospitals that are more than 10KM away.
//    - For other cases (severity < 8), exclude hospitals that are more than 30KM away.
//    - Use the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between the user's location and the hospital's location.
// 4. Process the remaining hospitals and rank them based on the appointment data fetched using a vector database.
// 5. Recommend the top 10 hospitals from the ranked list.
